# Titanic-Survival
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a machine learning model that predicts the survival chances of Titanic passengers based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model

# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.

## Open in Kaggle or Google Colab

## Dataset
The dataset includes features like:
- PassengerId
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of embarkation)
- Survived (Target variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Model and Approach
The project involves the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature selection)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
3. Training different machine learning models
4. Evaluating models based on accuracy and other metrics

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`titan.ipynb`).
4. Run the cells step by step to see the analysis and results.

## Results
The model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Based on the results, the best-performing model is selected.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
- Testing with more advanced models such as ensemble methods.
- Feature engineering to improve predictive power.
